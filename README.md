# Dwarves Playbook

Dwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm. We have been building an organization with high standard software practices and business growth capabilities, helping tech startups, entrepreneurs and makers deliver their innovative software product since 2013.

We stand for the craftsmanship in software development. More than telling people how to do things, as a team, we take responsibility for collaboratively creating the product of innovation with the client. We value the long-term partnership, and we brought the economic impact through massive product distribution and brought to the market by the clients.

This repo is our playbook which contains our practices in software development and also how we collaborate to make them succeed.
