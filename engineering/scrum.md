###Scrum at Dwarves Foundation

Agile, Scrum, XP... These are the trendy keywords that always on the top of the results for software development methodology

- Everyone knows about Scrum
- A lot of people wants to apply Scrum
- But only a few people really use Scrum

SO what is ***Scrum*** exactly?


#Sprint
**Timebox:** 1 month or less (Preferable: 2 weeks)
**Roles:** Whole teams
**Remarks:**
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- Quality goals do not decrease
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

During the Sprint, there are four Sprint Events that will happen:

## Sprint Events

#Sprint Planning

## Scratching the itches
# I changed my mind, again!!!
**It's Agile, we can change anything at anytime!** Sounds familiar?

For the teams that have a Scrum Master, it's his/her responsibility to protect the team from those changes during the Sprint, but for the smaller teams that work directly with clients they usually being distracted by those changes all the time.

Changes are inevitable, but everyone needs to remember that changes take *Time*, *Effort* and therefore *Money*

>>>**No problem, just stick it into the backlog**

Then we can discuss it in the Sprint Planning

# Ain't nobody got time for that
“Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.” — *Scrum Guide*
