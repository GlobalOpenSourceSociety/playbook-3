# Technology Stack

### Our perspective on Technology

#### New technology needs to provide actual value over existing solutions.

Software is changing the world every day. Software moves fast. The technology you used yesterday may be deprecated today. New technology has enabled us to create new things. 

The world is running by the goodwill of people who try to make it a better place. With the existing set of problems, new solutions will come out along with new technologies. When we look at new tech, we think about the movement of the market & society on which the new tech could fit in. The main idea is to see if the new tech could help to make anything better than before in the long run and also serve our development direction.

#### Make sure you understand both the old technology and the new one before buying into the next new thing.

We continuously evaluate new technologies using our tech radar. They are classified into topics: Techniques, Tools, Platforms, Languages & Frameworks with category:

- Adopt: We feel strongly that the industry could be adopting these items. We use them approriate on our projects.
- Trial: Worth pursuing. It is important to understand how to build up this capability. We could try those technologies on a project that can handle the risk.
- Assess: Worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will affect the company.
- Hold: The items that need to proceed with caution.
